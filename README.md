# Portal Prelude RTX Steam Deck mod
Portal Prelude RTX on Steam Deck? It might sound unlikely, but here at NightSightProductions, we’re all about pushing the limits of hardware—and we’ve made it happen.

This mod includes custom graphics presets designed specifically for the Steam Deck, based on extensive testing to find the best ways to play. The presets included are:

    High
    Medium
    Low

You’ll also find a list of instructions and recommended resolutions in the README.txt file.

Whether you’re aiming for high frame rates, impressive graphics, or the highest resolution possible, this mod has you covered on the Steam Deck. We hope you enjoy our work, and we look forward to seeing you explore more of our projects in the future.

Note: This mod is designed to work on Linux only
