FSR 3.1 can be toggled through ALT + X and changing upscaler to DLSS

 Recommended resolutions and fps limits for presets:
  1280x800 or 1600x900 (Recommend FSR Performance with 900p)

  Low: 60 (FSR Ultra Performance)
  Medium: 40 (FSR Performance)

Warning: While in ALT + X dev menu, do not go to the remix graphics menu, this will revert some changes and reduce performance (Only if using TAA-U or NIS, Does not affect FSR)
